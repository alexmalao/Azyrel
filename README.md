## Azyrel: Path To Ascension (Working Title)

This project is a (stub), please support it by sending Akyra tons of love!

A brief description of the project: This game is a 2D fast-paced
platformer heavily inspired by Dustforce with changes to include more expressive
combat and magic gameplay while also roping in my take on high fantasy. The story follows
between four playable characters who each have their own respective weapon class and
two types of magics.

Azyrel Angelo is a blond haired spellsword who recently lost his mother immediately
prior to the start of his journey. His memory is hazy and wishes to find his missing
father who must know the origin of a recently appeared accursed. He has mastery of
both ice and fire magic.

Akyra Synthia is a red haired knight from the Sky Isles who seeks revenge for her
fallen brother who she lost to the aforementioned accursed. She travels far in spite
of her duty to uncover the mystery that brought suffering to the world. She has
mastery of spirit arts and chaos magic.
